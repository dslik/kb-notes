### Problem Description

My Mac Pro is not driving my display using chroma 444. This causes colours to distort and fringe, and hurts my eyes.

### System Configuration

Mac Pro --> Thunderbolt 2 port --> Mini-DVI to DisplayPort adapter -> DisplayPort to HDMI cable -> Display

Mini DVI to DisplayPort adapter is the StarTech.com Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter - Active mDP 1.4 to HDMI 2.0 Video Converter

### Notes

I know that the display is capable of chroma 444, since I was able to get it working on my laptop with a USB-C to HDMI adapter. But I don't have any notes on how I change the software configuration to enable it.

### Status

Open Problem
