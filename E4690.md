# Radeon E4690

## 2023-10-15

I have a Windows 7 system that uses an Radeon E4690 video card. It was set up with a monitor I no longer have. Attempting to set it up with a second monitor results in a black screen after Windows boots or resumes.

I know that the cables and monitor are working because I tested them with a different computer, and the video displays correctly during boot.

### Basic troubleshooting

Booting in Windows "Low resolution mode" does not work.

Booting in Windows "Safe mode" does allow the video to display, but the only available resolution is 640x480 and 800x600, with 640x480 no longer being available after selecting 800x600.

Tried setting "Basic Video Mode" in msconfi. No change

Tried removing all extended video settings via RegEdit. No change

Tried adjusting the default video settings via RegEdit. No change. DefaultSettings.XResolution and  DefaultSettings.YResolution are set to 1024 x 768, respectively. Still does not show video after starting Windows.

### VNC

Installed and configured VNC. Can now connect when the system boots in regular mode, even when the display is not showing any output.

The system still will not allow any resolution changes outside of 640x480 and 800x600.

The system is recognizing the monitor (A NEC MultiSync EA234WMi), but it is using the default "Generic PnP Monitor" for it:

### Driver updates

Installed the newer NEC drivers, and now it shows up as the right monitor, but the resolution still can't be changed:

Installed the newer E4690 drivers, but the resolution *still* can't be changed:

However, at one point during the installation, the monitor did display the desktop, at 1024x768, so I know that the hardware is capable of this and is working. This is some sort of strange software problem.

Another section of the E4690 tool correctly shows the highest resolution supported by the monitor:

But it will not let me select these resolutions.

### Protocol analyzer

Checking with an HDMI protocol analyzer indicates that it is outputting 800x600, but some of these values are a little odd:

When I connect the output to the analyzer, I am now getting this error message:

So despite the DisplayPort to HDMI adapter working fine on other computers, I'm going to get another one to test with, to see if that eliminates the problem.

Next steps:
* Test with different DisplayPort cable
