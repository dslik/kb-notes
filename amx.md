# AMX Panel

## 2023-07-29

I have a MXT-2000XL-PAN-NC that I am working on getting running.

I have purchased a S Series Multi Preview Live [FG5968-10](https://www.amx.com/en/product_documents/mxa-mpl-datasheet-pdf) to provide the required 12V.

Next steps is to get the Phoenix contact connectors and make some power cables.
